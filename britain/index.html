1652-1784 Anglo-Dutch Wars\n

To find out the cause of this war, I went to England in 1652. It is the first stop of the investigation.\n

This war took place because Britain and the Netherlands were competing for sovereignty over maritime trade.\n

I can give you some information on this website. You have to read it carefully. :D\n
